'''String is a data type in python.
    We can primarily write a string in these three ways
    1. single quoted strings i.e 'Akriti'
    2. Double quoted strings i.e "Akriti"
    3. Triple quoted strings 

    '''

greeting = "Good Morning, "
name = "AKRITI"
print(type(name))
print(greeting + name)

# finding length
print(name[2])
 # name[4] = "a" --> Does not work

 #finding slicing
print(name[2:6])
print(name[-3:4])
